# Code-Portfolio---ANLY-506-51-B-2019-Summer---Exploratory-Data-Analytics
Creating a code portfolio for the codes that we learnt during our class ANLY 506 Exploratory Data Analytics

This is the code portfolio for ANLY 506 - Exploratory Data Analytics. 

Here we studied various topics in 12 weeks with majorly covering topics like Data Import, Wrangling, Visualization, cluster, PCA code. 

Code files are created in both R script and RMD since we learnt both. 

Each week's codes show the topic that we learnt and codes that we practiced during that following week.
